​
An incredible investment opportunity to acquire probably the longest documented combat history of a WW2 Spitfire in the world today ! BL688 was delivered into service on the 25th of January 1942 and served until 29th of May 1945. It served with five RAF Fighter Squadrons, as well as the USAAF 335 FG & US Navy on D-Day.
 
So far, 47 Allied pilots have been identified from Australia, Canada, Caribbean, Free French, India, Poland , UK , New Zealand and USA. Some of the men served only a short period and met their fate in combat against the enemy. Others flew BL688 with distinction and survived the war and went onto achieve great things.
